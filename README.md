# SMS-Spam-Detection-System-using-NLP
The project focuses on creating a Spam Detection System using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. 
This project explores the development of a spam detection system leveraging NLP. By processing and analyzing text data, the system extracts meaningful features and applies machine learning models for classification. The use of NLP enables the system to understand the nuances of language, making it capable of handling variations in spam content.
The project not only aims to build an efficient spam classifier but also emphasizes the importance of using AI to solve real-world problems. With increasing digital communication, such systems play a crucial role in ensuring secure and clutter-free user experiences across platforms.
